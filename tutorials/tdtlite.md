In this tutorial, you'll set up a simple TDTlite project culminating in a .tsv database of instances of "some" with additional information about each instance -- e.g., the match's unique TGrep2 ID, the full sentence, whether "some" occurs in the partitive, and whether "some" occurs at the start of a sentence. To do this easily, use TDTlite, a wrapper that allows for batch calling of perl scripts that make up the TDT.

## Set up the project structure

This section provides a project structure skeleton for setting up your project. We'll go into more detail about what each of these folders and files does in time, but to begin you should have a "project" folder. This will house all the files needed for your project. Inside of this folder, you should have:

1) A "ptn" folder. This folder consists of two subfolders, called "StringVar" and "CatVar".

2) A "data" folder. 

3) A "results" folder. This is where the results of your queries will go.  

You can find the structure you will need represented visually below:
